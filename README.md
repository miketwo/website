# Personal Website

A place for me to play with Google App Engine. This is hosted live at http://miketwo.net

# Development

To start a development instance, run from the project root
```
dev_appserver.py .
```

To deploy, run the `deploy.sh` script.

# ToDo

 - Hack together dynamic resume (a resume that can be filtered/highlighted)
    - Add education
    - Add publications
    - Add personal
    - Figure out how you want to do nested bullets

 - Once it looks good, rewrite the dynamic resume in Angular

 - Consider adding a blog?
 - Consider removing complete address from site/resume (and also purge git
   history)
